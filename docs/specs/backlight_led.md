# Wlf Keyboard — White Backlight System

## Overview

Wlf uses a **single-zone white LED backlight** inspired by Apple's Magic Keyboard and MacBook keyboards. The objective is to provide a subtle, elegant, and battery-efficient backlight while keeping the hardware simple, inexpensive, and easy to manufacture using JLCPCB SMT Assembly.

Each keyboard half contains:

- One Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Plus
- One AO3400A N-Channel MOSFET
- One warm white LED underneath each switch
- One current-limiting resistor per LED
- Dedicated LED power rail (`LED_VCC`)
- PWM brightness control

The entire backlight is controlled as a **single lighting zone**, allowing global brightness adjustment through PWM without requiring a dedicated LED driver.

### Why No LED Driver?

Wlf Rev. A intentionally avoids dedicated LED driver ICs (IS31FL37xx family).

Instead, all LEDs are switched simultaneously using a single PWM-controlled MOSFET.

#### Advantages

- Only one GPIO required
- Very small BOM
- Extremely simple schematic
- Easy PCB routing
- Excellent battery life
- Minimal firmware complexity
- Fully supported by ZMK PWM

#### Trade-offs

Supported:

- ✅ Backlight ON/OFF
- ✅ Global brightness control
- ✅ PWM dimming
- ✅ Fade in / Fade out
- ✅ Auto-off after inactivity

Not supported:

- ❌ Per-key brightness
- ❌ Reactive typing
- ❌ Ripple animations
- ❌ RGB effects
- ❌ Multiple lighting zones

# Power Architecture

Unlike the MCU and OLED, the backlight **does not use the XIAO's regulated 3.3 V output**.

Instead, the LEDs are powered directly from the battery.

Advantages:

- Lower regulator load
- Better battery efficiency
- Lower regulator temperature
- Higher available current
- Easier future expansion

The battery voltage is distributed into two independent branches:

- XIAO VBAT input
- LED_VCC (Backlight power rail)

# PCB Design Guidelines

## LED Placement

- One LED centered underneath each switch.
- Keep the LED as close as possible to the switch opening.
- Maintain consistent orientation across the PCB.

## MOSFET Placement

Place the AO3400A:

- Close to the XIAO module
- Close to the `LED_PWM` GPIO
- Close to the main `LED_SWITCH` return path

This minimizes PWM trace length and switching noise.

## Capacitor Placement

Place the **10uF** and **100nF** capacitors:

- Immediately after the `LED_VCC` power entry
- Close together
- Before the LED power distribution begins

## Power Routing

Recommended trace widths:

| Signal | Recommended Width |
|----------|------------------:|
| BAT+ | 1.0 mm |
| LED_VCC | 0.5–1.0 mm |
| LED_SWITCH | 0.5–1.0 mm |
| LED_PWM | 0.20–0.25 mm |

Possible upgrades include:

- Ferrite bead between `BAT+` and `LED_VCC`
- Current sensing
- Polyfuse protection
- Dedicated LED regulator
- I²C LED driver
- Multiple lighting zones

None of these upgrades require changing the LED placement or mechanical design.
